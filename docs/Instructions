## 📝 What’s inside?

Each row contains:
	1.	Pair # – The number of the comparison (e.g., Pair 1, Pair 2).
	2.	Overlap % – How much the two texts share, shown as a percentage.
	3.	Common Words – Words that appear in both texts.
	4.	Text 1 – The first piece of text being compared.
	5.	Text 2 – The second piece of text being compared.
	6.	Highlighted 1 – Text 1 with common words highlighted in red (font color).
	7.	Highlighted 2 – Text 2 with common words highlighted in red (font color).

## 🎨 How to read it?

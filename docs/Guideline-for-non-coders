What Does This Script Do?

This script checks how similar pieces of text are to each other. It takes blocks of text from a file (like an Excel sheet), finds the words they have in common, and shows you:
1. How similar they are in percentage terms.
2. Which words they share.
3. A way to see those shared words highlighted in color.

Basically, if you have a list of sentences or descriptions, the script will help you see which sentences share many common words.

Why Is This Useful?
•	Comparison: You might have many descriptions or notes and want to see which ones are closely related.
•	Duplicate Detection: If some texts are almost the same, the script tells you.
•	Highlighting: It color-codes the repeated words so you can visually spot them quickly.

How To Use It
1.	I used Anaconda and from there Jupyter Notebook for this code

pip install pandas openpyxl nltk ipython


	•	Press Enter.

3. Download NLTK Stopwords (A List of Common Words Like “the”, “a”, “an”)
	•	In Python, type:

import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')


•	This makes sure the script can ignore very common words.

4. Get Your Data Ready
	•	You should have an Excel file with text in at least one column.
	•	Put that Excel file in the same folder as the script.
	•	Change the script so it knows which column to read (by default, it looks for a column named describeTheSpecificHazards).
5. Run The Script
	•	In your terminal, navigate to the folder where the script is located (for example, cd path_to_your_folder).
	•	Then type:

python similarity_analysis.py


	•	This will run the script.

What Happens Next?
1. The Script Reads Your Excel File
	•	It looks at your chosen column and takes up to 20 rows of text to compare.
2. It Cleans the Text
	•	Turns everything to lowercase.
	•	Removes common “stopwords” like “the” and “is,” and takes out punctuation.
	•	This is to focus on the meaningful words only.
3. It Compares Each Pair of Texts
	•	It calculates a percentage for how similar the texts are.
	•	Lists the common words each pair has.
4. It Creates an HTML File
	•	The file is named something like similarity_results.html.
	•	This file shows each pair, their similarity percentage, and the words in common.
	•	You will also see each text with highlighted words, so you can quickly spot the overlaps.
5. It Creates an Excel File
	•	The file is named something like similarity_results.xlsx.
	•	Inside, you’ll see the same comparisons.
	•	There’s also a special trick: words that appear in both texts are colored inside the same cell. This makes it easy to see what’s repeated.

⸻

What Should I Look At First?
	•	Open the HTML file (double-click or open it in your browser).
	•	Scroll through the table.
	•	You can quickly see which texts match strongly. A high overlap means they share more unique words.

⸻

Questions or Changes?
	•	If you need to compare more than 20 lines, open the script and look for the line text_data = df[col].dropna().tolist()[:20]. Change 20 to however many rows you want.
	•	If your Excel column has a different name, change the variable col to match that name.
	•	If you have a CSV file instead of Excel, you can swap pd.read_excel(...) for pd.read_csv(...), but keep in mind you’ll need to remove engine="openpyxl".

Summary

This script is meant for non-technical users who just want to compare text. All you do is:
	•	Install the required tools,
	•	Update the column and file name if needed,
	•	Run the script,
	•	Check your new HTML and Excel files.

It’s a handy, quick way to spot repeated content or see how much overlap there is between different pieces of text.

Enjoy exploring your texts!
